# Full Stack Developer Portfolio
Portfolio with all the projects I've done in UC Berkeley Extension with summaries for each project, technology used for each project, and links to their respective Github and Demo. About me that describes myself and aspirations for being a full-stack web developer.

All built with React.js for quick and responsive browsing. Deployed on Github pages.
